<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The App

Welcome to a wonderful Bingo Game. As the captain of a submarine stopped by a giant squid, you'll need to win a bingo game to continue your journey.

## Bingo Rules

- Bingo is played on a set of boards, each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers.
- Numbers are chosen at random and marked on all boards on which they appear.
- If all numbers in any row or column of a board are marked, that board wins.
- Diagonals don't count.
- Data sets should be called from external txt files (Data sets sit in mockedData folder).

## Implemented Features

- Bingo Game functionality based on the rules above;
- Responsive design;
- Mobile-first approach;
- Unit testing using Jest, including edge cases;

## Ideas for Future Features

- Add Bingo Card generation functionality to enable creating Cards on a fly during the setup;
- Add option to generate random numbers on a fly during the game if dataSet random numbers are not provided;
- Add Storybook for better component development;
- CI/CD using Github Actions;
- Add e2e tests using Cypress and Argos Screenshots;
- Add more graceful and "smart" error handling, providing the user with more information about the error and the development team with more information about the error;
- Move assets to Cloudinary (that hosts with on AWS and optimizes them for all devices) for maximum performance;
- Using dependency injection for better code scalability & testability;
- Logging & monitoring using FullStory;
- Crash/Error reports using Sentry;
